For the sample input `{\"Projector\": 6, \"AC\": 9, \"Lights\": 4}` (with thresholds: Projector > 5, AC > 8, Lights > 6), the function correctly returned `['Projector', 'AC']` as overused resources and `True` for an energy alert.\n",
        "*   The `online_event_registration_controller` function accurately managed event registrations. Given an event capacity of 100 and 105 total registrations, the function correctly calculated 100 confirmed registrations, 5 waitlisted users, and set the registration status to 'Waitlist'.\n",

        "*   **Smart Classroom Resource Usage Monitor**: The current implementation effectively flags individual resources. Future enhancements could include aggregating total energy consumption or suggesting corrective actions for overused resources.\n",
